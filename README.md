Autonomous mobile robots play a crucial role in modern robotics, especially in tasks involving exploration, mapping, and navigation. A differential-drive rover is a simple yet powerful platform for understanding autonomous systems because it demonstrates real-time sensing, actuation, simulation, and environment interaction.
In this project, we designed and simulated a 2-wheeled differential drive rover equipped with a LiDAR sensor, implemented in ROS2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic. The rover can explore its surroundings, collect sensor data, and autonomously generate a 2D occupancy grid map using SLAM. This project demonstrates core robotics concepts like URDF modeling, ROS2 nodes, transforms, simulation, sensor fusion, and mapping.
